# Canara Robeco Download & Extraction Workflow Guide

## ✅ Simplified Workflow (After Update)

### **Manual Download (One Command)**

```powershell
# Download for a specific month - extraction happens automatically!
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts/canara_auto_download.py --year 2025 --month 4

# That's it! The script will:
# 1. Download the Excel file
# 2. Validate it
# 3. Automatically extract to JSON
# 4. You're done! ✅
```

### **Automated Monthly Download (Scheduled)**

The scheduled task runs automatically on the 5th of each month and:

1. Downloads previous month's data
2. Validates the file
3. **Automatically extracts to JSON**
4. Logs everything

**No manual intervention needed!**

## 🔄 How Auto-Extraction Works

**After successful download:**

1. ✅ File downloaded and validated
2. 🔄 Script automatically runs `extract_all_funds.py`
3. 📊 JSON files generated in `data/` folder
4. ✅ Ready to view in UI immediately

**The extraction script:**

- Processes **all** Excel files (both Mirae Asset and Canara Robeco)
- Skips files with errors gracefully
- Overwrites existing JSON (always fresh data)
- Takes ~5 seconds to process all files
